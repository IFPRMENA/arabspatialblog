## IFPRI 2020 Conference

The IFPRI 2020 Conference, held May 15-17, 2014 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, will bring together policymakers, practitioners, and scholars to discuss how resilience can be strengthened for food and nutrition security. The conference will:

- Articulate an intellectual framework for resilience;
- Identify key emerging shocks that pose the biggest threats to food and nutrition security, where resilience needs to be significantly strengthened;
- Assess experiences through case studies and draw out lessons from programs, policies, institutions, and investments around the world;
- Identify key approaches and tools to build resilience to shocks;
- Set priorities for action by different actors and in different regions; and
- Identify knowledge and action gaps in research, policy, and programming that need to be met or scaled up in order to successfully build resilience to food and nutrition insecurity.
