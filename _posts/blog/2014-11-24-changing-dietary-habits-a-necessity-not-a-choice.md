Arab countries import half of their needs of basic foodstuffs. Their agricultural production faces tremendous challenges, mainly drought, limited arable lands, scarce water resources and accelerated population growth, amidst adverse impacts of climate change. Unfortunately, Arab countries have been largely unsuccessful in dealing with the challenges of their limited natural resources. Falling agricultural production is attributed mainly to inappropriate policies, meager investments in science and technology, poor agricultural development and the absence of regional cooperation. These are some of the conclusions of the Arab Forum for Environment and Development ([AFED](http://www.afedonline.org/en/)) report on food security, to be released this week at the organization’s [annual conference](http://www.afedonline.org/conference/default.asp) in Amman, Jordan.

Still, the report reaches a positive conclusion. Though critical, the report emphasizes that Arab countries can reverse this descending trend through a package of measures. Most importantly through improved land productivity and higher irrigation efficiency. Alongside correct policies and advancing agricultural scientific research, the report highlights the need for regional cooperation, relying on comparative advantages, in a region known for significant discrepancies in natural resources and income levels amongst its countries. 

The [AFED](http://www.afedonline.org/en/) report illustrates success stories of model projects in Egypt, Morocco, Sudan, Syria and Tunisia. There, land productivity increased through successfully employing integrated management methods for water use and crop production. Water productivity can also be enhanced by using alternative commodities with similar nutritional value, requiring less water. It is necessary to adopt non-conventional methods, most importantly the reuse of treated wastewater.

Food and water are interrelated, especially in this driest region on earth. Per capita share of renewable fresh water in the region is eight times less than the global average. Thirteen out of the 22 Arab countries suffer severe water scarcity and renewable water resources are less than 100 m3 per capita. The [AFED](http://www.afedonline.org/en/) report classified six of the Arab countries in a new “exceptional water scarcity” category. Furthermore, there are regions where arable land with abundant fresh water is very scarce. The challenge magnifies as 85% of the water is used for agriculture, where the average irrigation efficiency in 19 Arab countries does not exceed 46%, compared to a global rate of 70%. If the Arab countries manage to reach the global rate, they can then save 50 billion m3 of water, an amount enough to produce 30 million tons of grains, half of the region’s imported grains.

Improving food security will require reducing food losses in transportation and storage. Losses in imported wheat, due to inefficient storage and transportation, exceed 3 million tons per year, equivalent to 40% of the region’s production of wheat. The total lost value of imported wheat and grains amounts to 4 billion dollars per year, equivalent to four months of wheat imports. The [AFED](http://www.afedonline.org/en/) report concludes that by developing the transportation sector and mainstreaming procedures for foodstuffs passing through border crossings, food prices can fall by 25% and budget deficits slashed by 30%.

The report also states that Arab countries, as a group, have the potential to become self-sufficient in seafood production, yet, they consume significant amounts of red meat, mostly imported. So, promoting fish and poultry production and consumption, to replace large portions of red meat, is beneficial for economic, environmental, as well as health reasons. Also shifting to agricultural products that consume less water, necessitates a change in food consumption patterns, especially if Egypt runs out of water to grow rice forcing it to turn to other commodities to feed a population of 200 million by 2050. For Saudi Arabia, can it continue to expand its milk exports and sustain its vast dairy cattle of over 200 thousand cows, by growing fodder using groundwater?

The shift in consumers’ habits is a daunting challenge. When former Saudi Minister of Trade, Dr. Hashim Yemani, asked Saudi citizens few years back to change their dietary habits, by replacing rice a few days of the week with another product following the spike in world food prices, he faced a fierce campaign leading to his replacement. Dr. Yemani may find consolation in the [AFED](http://www.afedonline.org/en/) report in that it emphasizes the necessity of adjusting dietary habits, as an essential component of any sound food security plan. The challenge in the region is not restricted to volatile and rising prices of imported products, as the day may come when we will not find sufficient water to produce rice in Egypt or grow fodder to feed cows in Saudi Arabia. 

Some may perceive the [AFED](http://www.afedonline.org/en/) report on food security in Arab countries as day dreams in a currently struggling region. However, following all the wars and conflicts, we cannot avoid daily feeding a 400 million, and growing, Arab population. This is feasible through increasing land productivity, improving irrigation efficiency and changing food consumption patterns, in parallel with regional cooperation. All these measures can be successful only if coupled with environment protection if stewardship of natural resources remains at the core of promoting production and attaining food security.

As for food safety, a burning issue in many Arab countries, officials have to examine the whole food chain to detect faults, not to limit attention to the end product, as we recently witnessed in Lebanon.
