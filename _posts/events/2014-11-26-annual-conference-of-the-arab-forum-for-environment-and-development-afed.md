Food Security in Arab Countries will be the subject of the 2014 annual report of the Arab Forum for Environment and Development (AFED). This report comes after six reports in AFEDâ€™s series on the State of Arab Environment, which started in 2008.

AFED reports have gained a reputation as the most credible sources on environment issues in the  Arab region, and are widely used all over the world.

Arab countries have been pursuing a target of higher food self-sufficiency rate, but achieving this goal remained beyond reach. While they have limited cultivable land and scarce water resources, they did not use their agricultural endowments in an effective and efficient manner. Lack of appropriate agricultural policies and practices led to diminishing the bio-capacity of the resources to regenerate their services and threatened agricultural sustainability.

The food crisis in recent years and the unprecedented spike in food prices, coupled with export restrictions imposed by some food producing countries reignited the call for ensuring reliable food sources for food import dependent countries. One such important source is domestic agriculture.

[The Conference](http://www.afedonline.org/conference/default.asp) will host side events organized by many regional and international organizations active in the field of food production, water and sustainable development in general.
