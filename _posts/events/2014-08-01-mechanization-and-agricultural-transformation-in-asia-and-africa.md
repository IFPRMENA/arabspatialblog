## Sharing Development Experiences

The International Food Policy Research Institute and The National School of Development at Peking University are jointly organizing a workshop on agricultural mechanization in Asia and Africa in Beijing.

Agricultural mechanization has recently become an emerging issue for Africa, while in many Asian countries the mechanization process started much earlier and has accelerated since the late 1980s.

The purpose of the workshop is to facilitate south-south knowledge exchange among national researchers, policymakers, and private sector participants for lessons and experiences of mechanization and agricultural transformation inAsian and African countries.

A particular focus will be on the role of the private sector in supporting sustainable agricultural mechanization development for countries in which small-scale farmers dominate.
