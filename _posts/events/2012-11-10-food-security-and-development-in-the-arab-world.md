While the Arab Awakening has brought much change and opportunity, the region remains highly vulnerable to shocks that contribute to food insecurity—one of the triggers of the uprisings. Stability hinges on Arab governments’ ability to accelerate economic growth, create jobs, and reduce poverty; their citizens will be closely watching progress on these indicators—as will the entire world.

The seminar will offer the latest development updates in the region, as well as debut a new map-based tool for the region—the Arab Spatial Development and Food Security Atlas. The tool, a joint IFPRI-IFAD-CGIAR initiative, will provide users country-by-country access to data on key indicators, an essential first step to measuring progress in bringing about food security and economic growth and development.
