Open Data is a hot topic in agricultural development. The topic has garnered so much interest that G8 leaders are holding an International Conference on Open Data for Agriculture on April 29 and 30. The following day, May 1, IFPRI shared its own wealth of Open Data at “D8”.

The event featured eight speakers, each with a five-minute ignite presentation to stimulate awareness, thought and action on Open Data. Among other things, you will learn about IFPRI’s Open Data for Agriculture, what’s available, who’s using it, how they’re using it, and how you can access it.

Join us for lunch and a smorgasbord of data sharing.
