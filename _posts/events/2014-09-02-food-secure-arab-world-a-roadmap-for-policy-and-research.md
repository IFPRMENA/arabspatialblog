International conference on "Food Secure Arab World: A Roadmap for Policy and Research" was organized by the International Food Policy Research Institute and the [United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia](http://www.escwa.un.org/)

The event featured presentations by leading thinkers in the fields that comprise food security — including economics, agriculture, water, trade, health, and nutrition — in addition to sessions on lessons learned from existing country development strategies. There was a priority-setting session using digital voting technology, public discussion, and opportunities for participants to connect with people who were similarly committed to sustainably ending food insecurity and poverty in the Arab world. Outcomes included a declaration on the principles for food security in the Arab world and a roadmap of ways to implement the recommended actions.
