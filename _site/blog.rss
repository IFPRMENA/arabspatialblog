  <title>Introducing Yemen Spatial</title>
  <link>/arabspatialblog/blog/2014/07/02/introducing-yemen-spatial/</link>
  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cross-posted from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ifpri.org/blog/introducing-yemen-spatial&quot;&gt;IFPRI Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;A tool to help the country reach its food security goals&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Yemen ranks among the ten most food-insecure countries globally and has child malnutrition rates of nearly sixty percent, the highest in the Arab World. These two figures underscore the country’s future social and economic development challenges.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arabspatial.org/?id=YEM&quot;&gt;Yemen Spatial&lt;/a&gt;, an online food security mapping and charting tool, was launched was launched last week in Sana’a at the joint &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mpic-yemen.org/mpic/&quot;&gt;Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation (MoPIC)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/&quot;&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization&lt;/a&gt; Food Security Information System (FSIS) Inception Workshop.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Yemen Spatial is a collaborative effort between Yemen’s Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation; MoPIC; IFPRI; the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pim.cgiar.org/&quot;&gt;CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM)&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ifad.org/&quot;&gt;International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)&lt;/a&gt;; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.giz.de/en/worldwide/369.html&quot;&gt;German international development organization GIZ&lt;/a&gt;. The objectives of the tool are to support the implementation of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ifpri.org/publication/food-basis-development-and-security&quot;&gt;Yemen’s National Food Security Strategy (NFSS)&lt;/a&gt;, to monitor and evaluate progress in key food security indicators such as calorie deficiency and child stunting, and to strengthen food security by making data and information available for policy.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The tool aggregates a full range of development data and is designed to facilitate the monitoring of food security outcomes at the national, governorate, and district levels for precise targeting of interventions. As part of the region-wide &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arabspatial.org/&quot;&gt;Arab Spatial application&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arabspatial.org/yemen&quot;&gt;Yemen Spatial&lt;/a&gt; builds on this technology to provide more specific national and subnational level data, and emphasizes indicators that are tailored to Yemen’s food security challenges and capacity.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“By providing more than 100 data indicators—including climate, biophysical, and socioeconomic data—Yemen Spatial enables users to visualize areas that are most vulnerable to food insecurity and target policies and research where they are most needed,” said Perrihan Al-Riffai of IFPRI.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The tool adheres to an open access policy: end users can browse and query, free of charge, a full range of databases, build interactive multilayer maps, and use customized analytical tools that allow them to compare, explore, download, and share these results.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The selection of data for Yemen Spatial follows an innovative food and nutrition security framework embedded in Yemen’s NFSS, which highlights the complex relationship between factors that affect food security from the individual and household levels to the national level.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“The creation of the Yemen Spatial application is a step in the right direction for providing us with the capacity to monitor our progress toward a food-secure country” said Dr. Abdul Wahed Mukred, Head of Yemen’s Food Security Technical Secretariat.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Nitrogen and Phosphorous: once wonder nutrients now threaten aquatic ecosystems</title>
  <link>/arabspatialblog/blog/2014/06/19/nitrogen-and-phosphorous-once-wonder-nutrients-now-threaten-aquatic-ecosystems/</link>
  <description>&lt;p&gt;Nitrogen and phosphorus are indispensable nutrients to crop plants. Their importance in achieving high crop productivity cannot be overestimated. Every year, farmers apply millions of tons of chemical fertilizers and manure rich in nitrogen and phosphorus to improve crop yields; these two nutrients are thus essential for food security.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;While nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are beneficial for crop production, excess nitrogen and phosphorus act as water pollutants. When too much nitrogen and phosphorus reach water bodies, eutrophication can occur, a situation where the fast growth of algae stimulated by enrichment of nitrogen and phosphorus depletes dissolved oxygen with potentially disastrous effects on aquatic ecosystems. Moreover, high levels of nitrate can also adversely affect human health; they can cause methemoglobinemia or blue baby syndrome, a condition found especially in infants.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Beyond 1000 Days</title>
  <link>/arabspatialblog/blog/2014/05/19/beyond-1000-days/</link>
  <description>&lt;h3&gt;New study shows that growth faltering in children continues after two years of age&lt;/h3&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The following story was originally published on the CGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH) blog.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The world has rallied around the importance of good nutrition in a child’s first 1000 days – from conception to two years—to set up a lifetime of good health. With momentum from global movements such as 1000 Days and Scaling up Nutrition, it has been well documented that a lack of good nutrition during this window can lead to negative consequences for a child’s cognitive and physical development.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>‘Let’s climate proof it’</title>
  <link>/arabspatialblog/blog/2014/02/01/-let-s-climate-proof-it/</link>
  <description>&lt;h3&gt;The UN celebrates World Day to Combat Desertification&lt;/h3&gt;




&lt;p&gt;As the impacts of our changing climate materialize and intensify, developing countries—and poor people who inhabit them—will be impacted first and to the greatest degree. Land degradation, desertification, and a dwindling global water supply pose substantial threats to livelihoods as well as food and national security.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Today, the United Nations (UN) celebrates its annual World Day to Combat Desertification. This year’s theme, “Land belongs to the future – Let’s climate proof it!” sounds the alarm on the importance of sustainable land management practices within the context of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;One-third of the world’s population currently lives in drylands, and desertification and droughts play a major role in both migration and displacement. According to the UN, 42 percent of the world’s very poor live in degraded areas, which translates to lower agricultural outputs as well as lower incentives for investing in productive technologies. What’s more, as the global population continues to swell, it is estimated that, by 2030, there will be a 50- percent increase in demand for food and a 30- percent increase in demand for water. How can we meet the challenge in the face of dwindling resources?&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>When Wells Fail: Farmers’ Response to Groundwater Depletion in India</title>
  <link>/arabspatialblog/blog/2013/04/19/when-wells-fail-farmers-response-to-groundwater-depletion-in-india/</link>
  <description>&lt;p&gt;Groundwater is the mainstay of irrigated agriculture in India. Hundreds of millions of smallholders depend on it for their livelihoods. These livelihoods, however, face serious threats from rapidly falling water tables in large parts of the country. What do farmers do when the wells run dry?&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In a recent study, Sheetal Shekhri compares villages in Uttar Pradesh that have access to groundwater at just below eight meters with villages where the groundwater level is just above eight meters.  The comparison is interesting because once the water table goes below eight meters, centrifugal pumps no longer work and farmers have to invest in submersible pumps—a much more expensive technology. The two sets of villages are otherwise quite similar to each other.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Sheetal finds that the incidence of poverty is significantly higher where groundwater irrigation requires more capital-intensive submersible pumps. Conflicts over water are also more frequent in these villages. Thus, falling groundwater tables can increase poverty even if water is not considered scarce, on average, such as in places like Uttar Pradesh.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The situation is more dire in water scarce regions of India, like in parts of the Mehsana district in North Gujarat. Here, aquifers are so depleted that digging deeper wells and installing more powerful pumps does not allow to access more water.  Often even deep wells have low and unreliable discharge, brackish water and a high rate of failure. While groundwater scarcity is found in large areas of India, pockets like Mehsana represent the more advanced stages of depletion.&lt;/p&gt;
