## Workshop on Biofuels and Food Security Interactions

The purpose of the workshop is to explore current and future interactions between biofuels and food security, and elaborate learnings from analysis and field experience relevant for project developers, researchers and policy-makers. The workshop is organized around a six discussion topics and is designed to encourage discussion among participants. We aim to identify where consensus lies regarding key barriers, gaps and opportunities related to (a) the assessment of biofuel-food security interactions and (b) recommendations for future research and implementation.
