Building on the experience of the past RNE Regional Multi-stakeholder Workshops on Food Security and Nutrition - Cairo (2011), Khartoum (2012), and Tunis (2013) - this yearâ€™s workshop will focus on three main objectives: 

1) Strengthening regional and global linkages around key food security and nutrition policy issues of relevance to the Near East and North African region:
Addressing food security and nutrition in protracted crises;
Promoting responsible investment in agriculture and food systems;
Addressing food losses and waste.

2) Facilitating regional multi-stakeholder partnerships and networks. 

3) Reflecting around the outcomes of previous Workshops and discussing the way forward.
